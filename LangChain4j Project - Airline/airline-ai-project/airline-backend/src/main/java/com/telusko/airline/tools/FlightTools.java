/**
 * Flight lookups, exposed to the agents as callable tools.
 * <p>
 * This is deliberately not RAG. Retrieval is for questions about text. "Which flights go to
 * Goa on Friday" is a question about rows, and a model reading a sample of flight documents
 * would invent a flight number. Every tool here runs a real query, so the assistant reports
 * flights that exist.
 * <p>
 * Note what the parameters are: Strings and ints. A {@code LocalDate} parameter becomes a
 * nested {@code year, month, day} object in the JSON schema, which does not match what the
 * description promises and is harder for the model to fill in correctly. Taking the date as
 * text and parsing it here is the version that works.
