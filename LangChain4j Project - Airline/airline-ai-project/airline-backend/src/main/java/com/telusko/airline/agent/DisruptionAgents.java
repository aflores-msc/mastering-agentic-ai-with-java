/**
 * The specialists the disruption supervisor delegates to.
 * <p>
 * All four live in one file because they only make sense together, and because reading them
 * side by side is how the delegation becomes obvious. Each one is narrow on purpose: an agent
 * with a single job writes a better answer about that job than a general assistant does about
 * everything, and a narrow agent can actually be tested.
 * <p>
 * The mechanism to notice is {@code outputKey}. When an agent finishes, its answer is written
 * into the shared AgenticScope under that key, and the next agent takes it as a parameter of
 * the same name. That is the whole of agent to agent communication here: not agents calling
 * each other directly, but a shared scratchpad the supervisor passes around. It is far easier
 * to debug than direct calls, because at any point you can print the scope and see exactly
 * what each agent contributed.
