/**
 * The tools this MCP server offers.
 * <p>
 * Everything here is information the airline does not own. Live weather, airport congestion
 * and the gate feed all come from somewhere else, and that is exactly why they sit behind MCP
 * rather than in the backend. The backend owns bookings; this server owns the outside world.
 * <p>
 * The data is hard coded so the project runs with no API keys beyond OpenAI. Swapping any of
 * these method bodies for a real HTTP call changes nothing about the backend, which is the
 * point of a protocol: the client never learns where the answer came from.
